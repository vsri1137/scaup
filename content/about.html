      <h2>Before I was a writer</h2>
      <p>
        I threw boozy parties for a living. Before that I was a designer at an
        investment bank. I even wore a suit. Before that I managed construction
        projects, and before that I sold knives door-to-door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm a UX content strategist and writer living in Oakland,
        California.
